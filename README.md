# lovejam2020
A love2d game made for the 2020 jam, "Frequency"

## Requirements
Love 11 is required to play.

## How to play
Start the game by running `love .` in the root directory.

Use the WASD/arrow keys to move, space to jump, and the Esc key to open the menu.

## Project Organization
The source code mostly lives in the `src` directory. Any lua file in there will be autoloaded.

The libraries are kept separate, so we can name their variables.
